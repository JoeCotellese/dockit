# Dockit

A simple app to run Docker containers easily.

- Create a folder on your machine (i.e., docker-apps)
- Create your docker-compose file in these folders

when you want to run those containers just type

`dockit container_name`

## FAQs 

Wait! Why not just use docker-compose?

Great question, I was doing that for a while, this tool is about centralizing and standardizing the way I invoke containers on my system. I want it to be nearly as easy as running a shell command.

Instead of 

```bash
cd /path/to/containers/openwebui
docker-compose up -d
```

I can just type

```bash
dockit openwebui
```

## Installation

Install via pipx or pip:

```bash
# Using pipx
pipx install .

# Or using pip
pip install .
```

## Usage

1. Create a config file at `~/.dockit_config` with the following content:

    ```ini
    [global]
    base_directory = ~/docker-apps  # Supports ~, $HOME, $PWD
    ```

2. Run a container:

    ```bash
    dockit <container_name>
    ```
